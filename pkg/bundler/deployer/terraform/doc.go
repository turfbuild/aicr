Package terraform generates a Terraform root module from an AICR recipe.

Per-component folder content (values.yaml, cluster-values.yaml, upstream.env,
Chart.yaml + templates/) is delegated to pkg/bundler/deployer/localformat, the
same writer the helm and helmfile deployers use. This package owns only the
Terraform layer on top: a root module with one module call per component, plus
the generic component module they all share.

# One module call per component

localformat emits up to four folders for a component — pre, primary, post,
readiness. They become slots on a single module call and chain inside it, so a
dependent's depends_on names the component and gets the whole chain. The flat
alternative, one call per folder, makes the module boundary lie: with
--readiness-hooks, depends_on = [module.gpu_operator] would not mean
gpu-operator is ready, and a dependent would have to name
module.gpu_operator_readiness to say so.

Assigning a folder to a slot means classifying it, which this package does with
the same suffix test argocd's waveForFolder uses (see phaseOf). localformat
reserves "-readiness" outright and rejects a component whose name would collide
with an injected "-pre"/"-post" sibling, which is what makes the comparison
safe.

# Deployment Ordering

Terraform's depends_on is a native DAG, so the recipe's declared dependencyRefs
project onto it exactly — the same fidelity the flux deployer gets from
dependsOn, and strictly more than the tier-based argocd (integer sync-waves)
and helmfile (nested level files) deployers, which can only approximate the
graph as depth tiers and therefore make every component wait on every sibling
at the prior depth.

Edges land in two places:

  - across components, on the module call: each call depends on the calls of
    its declared dependencyRefs. A ref naming a component absent from the
    enabled set (disabled via overrides, or provided externally) is dropped —
    depends_on = [module.absent] is a parse error, not a plan error.
  - within a component, on the resources inside the module: pre -> primary ->
    post -> readiness, in that fixed order.

Under Serial (--serial) the cross-component edges collapse to a single chain
through deployment order, so components apply strictly one at a time.

# Why depends_on on the module call

A depends_on on a call is a fact about everything the module contains, which is
exactly the claim a dependent wants to make. It also lets a reader of main.tf
see the recipe graph without opening the module.

# Readiness gates

With ComponentReadiness set, a component's gate is the last slot in its module:
a Job asserting the signal that actually means ready, which helm's own wait
cannot see. The slot hardcodes wait rather than reading var.wait, so a
component carrying an async override (see deployer.ComponentOverrideFor)
cannot disarm its own gate.

The gate Job carries the same helm.sh/hook annotations the helm deployer's gate
does, and the hook is what holds the release open: helm waits for a hook to
complete as part of the release. The slot therefore sets wait but not
wait_for_jobs, which covers Jobs in the release's own resource set and so would
do nothing for a hook — the same reason deploy.sh passes --wait without
--wait-for-jobs. The apply does not return, and dependents do not start, until
the Job succeeds, and a failing gate fails the apply.

hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation is what lets the gate re-assert. A
Job's spec.template is immutable, so an unchanged manifest is a no-op patch;
without the delete-and-recreate the gate would assert once, when it is created.

That covers every upgrade Terraform actually performs on this release. It does
not cover an upgrade elsewhere in the component: helm_release tracks chart,
version and values, not rendered manifests, so a gate release whose own inputs
are unchanged plans clean and is never upgraded at all. Re-asserting on a
dependency's upgrade needs the gate release to carry something that moves with
it — a content digest — which is a follow-up, not a property of this code.

# Cluster connection

The generated root module does NOT create a cluster. It configures the helm
provider from variables, so the bundle applies against whatever cluster the
operator points it at:

  - var.kubeconfig_path / var.kube_context for an existing kubeconfig (default);
  - var.cluster_host / var.cluster_ca_certificate / var.cluster_token when the
    cluster is created in the same configuration and its attributes are only
    known after apply.

The second form composes with a cluster resource in the same configuration.
helm_release does not contact the API server at plan time, so a provider
configuration that is only known after apply does not block the plan: a
measured run of stock terraform applies the whole bundle, cluster included, in
a single round. See README.md in the generated bundle.

# Cluster rollover

A helm_release's state describes objects inside one cluster. Replace the
cluster and those objects are gone, but the release rows remain — state that
confidently describes nothing.

With ClusterRollover set, each component module carries one terraform_data
keyed on var.cluster_endpoint, and every slot in it a replace_triggered_by
pointing at that resource. A changed endpoint replaces the shim, which replaces
every release: destroy-then-create, Terraform's default replacement, one
release at a time in dependency order.

The endpoint is the flag's whole premise, and that is also its limit. The
trigger is var.cluster_host in root-module form — the opt-in binding described
under "Cluster connection", set when the cluster is declared in the same
configuration. On the default kubeconfig path cluster_host is null, so the
trigger is a constant and the flag does nothing. It is not keyed on
kube_context instead: a context name is a local alias, not a cluster identity,
and renaming one would tear down the stack. Hence off by default.

# Component Type Support

Only Helm components are supported. Kustomize components produce an
ErrCodeInvalidRequest at generation time, matching the flux deployer.

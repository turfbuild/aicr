// Bundle layout is the last of the four surfaces ROADMAP section 1 freezes at
// v1 (issue #2113, scope items 1, 2 and 5's layout half).
//
// An integrator's automation reads paths out of a bundle: a GitOps pipeline
// commits argocd/app-of-apps.yaml, an operator runs helm/deploy.sh, a script
// walks NNN-<component>/values.yaml. None of that was gated. The per-deployer
// golden trees under pkg/bundler/deployer/*/testdata cover a single deployer's
// rendering; nothing asserted the shape of a whole bundle, so a renamed root
// file or a changed directory convention would ship silently.
//
// # Why a fixture recipe rather than the live catalog
//
// Some emitted names are recipe-derived, not layout: flux writes one
// helmrepo-<host>.yaml per chart repository, and helmfile writes level-N.yaml
// per dependency depth. A baseline taken against the live catalog would churn
// whenever a recipe changed, and a baseline that churns is one people
// regenerate without reading -- which is the failure mode this gate exists to
// prevent.
//
// testdata/layout/recipe.yaml is a frozen two-component recipe, trimmed to the
// fields that can influence the emitted tree. It changes only when someone
// changes it.
